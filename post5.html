<p>During Medicare Open Enrollment, it’s important for seniors to take the time to review their coverage for 2021. Most people don’t shop during Open Enrollment — and that’s a potentially costly mistake.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In case you need a refresher, Medicare Advantage is the private portion of Medicare. Sold by individual companies, it covers all of the same benefits as Original Medicare (that’s by law), plus extras that vary by plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those “extras” are important: prescription drugs, dental and vision coverage, hearing aids and exams, gym memberships, 24/7 nurse phone lines, post-hospital meal delivery and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over a third of Medicare members now choose these private plans over Original Medicare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if you like Original Medicare and want to keep it, know that you also have options for filling in some of the gaps in coverage and cost. Medicare Part D, a private prescription drug plan, can help you pay for prescriptions. And Medigap, a Medicare supplement plan, can help take care of some of your out-of-pocket costs under Original Medicare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Point being, there are several ways to supplement or replace your Original Medicare coverage with a private plan. You may save money and gain access to benefits you wouldn’t otherwise get.</p>

<p>Here are some important updates and information for Medicare in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medicare Advantage continues to attract new members. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) expects enrollment in MA plans to hit nearly 27 million people in 2021 — an estimated 42% of the total Medicare population. And at least some of that historically high enrollment will be from people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the first time in 2021, people with ESRD can now enroll in a private Medicare Advantage plan without any of the restrictions they faced before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before 2021, people with end-stage renal disease could only have Advantage if they had it before they were diagnosed with the disease or were otherwise grandfathered in. That restriction has been lifted. And newly diagnosed ESRD patients can now buy Medicare Advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So if you or a loved one has ESRD and wants to check out the benefits of a private health plan, now’s the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The estimated enrollment bump for 2021 represents a 44% increase in the number of MA members since 2017. On the whole, enrollment in private Medicare plans has increased steadily over the last decade, primarily thanks to lower costs and broader benefits.</p>
