CMS assesses private Medicare health and drug plans on a range of categories. The overall goal is to help Medicare members identify plans that perform well and to enroll in top-tier coverage.</p>

<p>The more stars a plan earns, the higher it performed across the range of metrics CMS uses to assign these ratings. Star ratings go from 1 star (worst performing) to 5 stars (best performing) and are updated each year in time for open enrollment.</p>

<p>Medicare Open Enrollment runs from October 15th through December 7th.</p>
