<p>Open enrollment for Medicare is underway. This is the annual election period designed to give people with Medicare a chance to review their coverage and make changes for the upcoming year. Whether you’ve got Original Medicare, a private drug plan through Part D or a Medicare Advantage plan, this is your best (and possibly only) chance during the year to update your coverage for 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With more plan options and lower premiums for next year, this is a great time to make sure that what you’ve got is still working for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re not someone who finds joy in shopping for coverage each year, you’re not alone. A whopping&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/press-release/7-in-10-medicare-beneficiaries-report-that-they-did-not-compare-their-coverage-options-during-a-recent-open-enrollment-period/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">71% of people</a>&nbsp;said in a recent survey that they don’t shop during Medicare open enrollment, which means just under 3 in 10 people actually take the time to do it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a potentially costly mistake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike other forms of health insurance, premiums tend to go down with private Medicare plans, for both Medicare Advantage and standalone Part D plans. And with added benefits in recent years, there are good reasons to see what else is out there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Need a reason to pull up your current plan and compare it to 2022 options? Here are a few good reasons to start shopping (if you haven’t already) during Medicare Open Enrollment.</p>

<h3><strong>There will be more Medicare Advantage plans overall.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next year’s Medicare Advantage plans continue a recent trend in offering potentially broader benefits to a wider pool of people across the U.S. On average, states will see about 115 private plans in 2022, up from last year’s average of 106. That’s according to our analysis of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-releases-2022-premiums-and-cost-sharing-information-medicare-advantage-and-prescription-drug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">state data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>&nbsp;(CMS), which administers the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, plan options in each state vary widely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some states have hundreds of plans available. That includes more populous states like California (458), Florida (583) and Texas (337). On the opposite end of the spectrum, Wyoming has just 9 Medicare Advantage plans in 2022, though that is a 50% increase in the number of plans the state had last year (6).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where you live continues to play an important role in your individual access to private Medicare plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same holds true for Medicare Part D, where there’s an average of 22 plans per state in 2022 but where location makes a difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when it comes to Part D, the average gives a closer idea as to individual state options. Most states have around this many offerings for Part D next year, with a high of 28 plans in Texas and a low of 19 plans in New York.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s worth noting that Part D plan availability has actually gone down somewhat for 2022, from an average of 29 plans nationwide last year to 22 in 2022. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that researches and reports on healthcare, attributes this decline to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-part-d-a-first-look-at-medicare-prescription-drug-plans-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plan consolidations from major carriers</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with around 20 plan options in each state, there may be a better choice for you next year. It doesn’t hurt to take a look.</p>
