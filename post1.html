<h3><strong>The Federal Government Will Negotiate Prices For Drugs</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right now, Medicare Part D prohibits the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from engaging in price negotiations between Part D plan sponsors and drug manufacturers. As a result, Medicare is required to subsidize the Part D program heavily but can’t set prices or establish a fee schedule. Similarly, Medicare Part B doesn’t have any means of price negotiation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Inflation Reduction Act will add an exception that enables the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices with drug manufacturers for certain classes of drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These include biosimilar competitors, single-source brand-name, or biologics without generic drugs covered in Medicare Part B (starting in 2028) and Medicare Part D (beginning in 2026).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Secretary will hold price negotiations with drug manufacturers to determine the Maximum Fair Prices (MFPs) for 10 qualifying drugs for 2026; 15 drugs for 2027 and 2028; and 20 drugs for 2029 and beyond. The program will only apply to Part D drugs in 2026 and 2027.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drug manufacturers that don’t comply with the requirements of the program could be subject to a civil monetary penalty or an excise tax.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The exercise tax amount will be set as a percentage of the sales price of a selected drug plus the excise tax imposed by the Inflation Reduction Act. That could range from&nbsp;<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12203#:~:text=The%20Act%20requires%20drug%20manufacturers,consumers%20%5BCPI-U%5D)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">65% to 95%</a>&nbsp;if a manufacturer were found to be out of compliance for more than 270 days.</p>
